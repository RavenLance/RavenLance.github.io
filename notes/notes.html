  Version: 0.1

  Description:

  This 'container' defines a container which will hold
  a list of uploaded HTML notes that have been converted
  from markdown from my own personal repository of notes.

  0.1 Description............

  This version has all of the files hard written into the
  html file. This was done merely to get the looks and
  functionality properly underway.

  The goal for 0.2 will be to create an automated script
  to read through the github directory for 'notes' and
  read through each directory for .html files and spit
  them into a list of links.

<div id="container2" style="top: 0px; left: 0px;">
  <!-- This script creates the menu functionality -->
  <script>
    </script>

  <!-- ho ho! what a wonderful header -->
  <h1>Notes</h1>

  <ul id="menuNotes">
    <li>High Speed Networks
      <ul>
        <li><button onclick="fillNotes()">Content Structure</button></li>
        <li><button onclick="fillNotes()">Lecture 1</button></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <!-- This script makes things draggable, which is kinda fun -->
  <script>
  $( "#container2" ).draggable();
  $(function() {
    $( "#menuNotes" ).menu();
  });
  </script>
</div>
