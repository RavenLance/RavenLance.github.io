RavenLance Startpage!
=====================

Please note that the original author to this style was Kopri-nb. If you want to check out how this all originated, take a look at this:

I felt this idea was a highly interesting approach, as I had never considered startpages having any significance until I stumbled upon a few uses for them. The obvious use for a startpage is to feed an individual quick access to commonly utilized pages and information (such as the weather). However I thought about something a little more interesting for my own personal startpage.

**What if I could utilize my startpage to give others access to information i wish to be distributed freely?**

This would mean simply any notes or information that I felt like sharing could be more simply managed by one single location with easy access. For instance, recommendations to music and media could simply be pulled from my list of most accessed links or any further sub-sections I happen to provide.

Now the fun to Kopri-nb's style is that they discovered a simple methodology to making a window-based environment, meaning I could instantiate a variety of different functions within 'windows' devised within my startpage. Yes they wouldn't function like real windows, but they would be able to provide some fun instances to work with.

As well, there was something that impressed me with Kopri-nb's original design. **It utilizes very little in resources**. This means you could leave the thing in the background and it won't claim much of anything, a true benefit of design as it isn't trying to do a lot of funny things. Simplicity is best.

## Current Features

The following capabilities have been added or are planned to be added to this startpage:

### links

These were already implemented in the original design, and there surely is no other reason to define how these work

### Note sub-sections (Still Working on it)

This subsection is a rather peculiar one. I have written a variety of notes in markdown and I wished to display. This subsection is managed via the 'notes' file where a JavaScript file auto loads all known files and categorizes them for display. this means all my notes only need to be modified and added to the list to properly work. Neat und Tidy.
